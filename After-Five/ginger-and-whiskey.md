Ginger and Whiskey 
==============

These are the bitters that do work with Rye and a sweeter ginger beer:  
* Chuncho
* Krangostura
* Lavender
These are the bitters that don not work well with rye whiskey and sweet ginger beer:  
* blood orange bitters
* grapefruit bitters
* teapot bitters

You can mix bourbon with ginger beer but I strongly recommend a very gingery or very sour ginger beer.  
These are the bitters that worked well with bourbon and ginger beer:  
* Chuncho
* Karis Island Elixers Cardammon Saffron

Grapefruit bitters in a very sour ginger beer is sort of pointless, it does not add much in terms of flavor and complexity and is just sour  

The following is stuff that was not tested by me (i.e. my dad came up with it):  
* Rye + sour ginger beer + lime bitters
