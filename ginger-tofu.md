Ginger-Tofu
===========

Ingredients
------------

 + tofu
 + sesame or grapeseed oil (not olive oil) 
 + white onion
 + garlic
 + fresh ginger
 + black pepper 
 + soy sauce or teriyaki sauce
 + sweet cherry peppers 
 + green onions

Procedure 
---------

1. Cube and fry the tofu in a pan. 
2. Add diced onions when the tofu is close to your desired consistency. 
3. Add pepper to taste. 
4. Add diced sweet cherry peppers 
5. There should be very little oil left and the tofu will probably start sticking to the pan. Add soy sauce or teriyaki sauce.  
6. Add green onions, and remove from heat. 
7. Serve on rice.  

Notes
------
 * Do not use salt. Soy sauce is already salty. 
 * Powdered ginger will stick to the tofu in clumps. Do not use it. 
 * Green onions burn easily, do not let them cook for long. 
 * You can remove the white or green onions, but do not remove both. 
 * Use a lot of ginger and garlic.
